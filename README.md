Using the [UN World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed) dataset, we can create a bar chart race graph with Matplotlib.

The initial data processing/cleaning code can be seen in [this notebook](./bar_chart.ipynb) and the animation code is in [bar_chart.py](./bar_chart.py)

## Line Graph Animation

Using stock data from [nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/historical), animate the prices of Nvidia, AMD, & Intel over time. Each of their daily prices can be found in the [./data](./data) folder.

The animation is created in [animated_graph.py](animated_graph.py)
